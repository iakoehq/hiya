            "questions": "If there’s no added sugar, how does your vitamin taste so sweet?",
            "answer": "Instead of including added sugar, our vitamins are sweetened with monk fruit extract — a super-fruit that is sweeter and tastier than sugar for a taste kids love. Each vitamin also includes a touch of mannitol — a sweetener found in strawberries and pumpkins and often recommended by dentists."

            "answer": "Up to five grams of added sugar, which at five grams is as much sugar as in an Oreo cookie — typically given by parents to kids every day as a way to be “healthy.”"

            "questions": "Why is your vitamin a chewable, not a gummy? ",
            "answer": "Gummy vitamins are often filled with pork-based additives and hard-to-pronounce ingredients, they can get stuck in your children’s teeth contributing to cavities, they can teach bad health habits by connecting health with candy, and they are often susceptible to heat and melting, which can result in fewer nutrients than expected. For parents concerned about keeping their kids strong and healthy, chewables is the preferred delivery method among many leading experts."

            "answer": "According to the numbers, 98% of kids eat too much added sugar, which can lead to lifelong problems with childhood development, mental health, obesity, and more. We are only now beginning to understand the negative effects of daily sugar intake, which is why our vitamins will never contain added sugar."

It’s dynamically formulated by a team of pediatricians and nutritionists to fill in common gaps based on modern nutritional guidelines. It’s also gluten-free, vegan, GMO-free, nut-free, and pretty much everything good you can think of."

            "questions": "Does my child really need a daily vitamin?",
            "answer": "The short answer is probably yes. According to the numbers, more than 90% of children don’t reach their recommended levels of fruits and vegetables. Hiya helps fill in common nutritional gaps without being a sugar-coated gummy vitamin, which unfortunately has become the default way for kids to be healthy. As always, when making any decisions about vitamins, we suggest consulting with your pediatrician or dentist for a recommendation and further information about any risks associated with added sugar and gummy additives."

            "answer": "Yes. While most other vitamins include so much junk that your child is supposed to eat up to four per day, ours is super-charged with all the ingredients they need in just one. Which means less stress for those in charge. Please consult your pediatrician with questions about dosage."
