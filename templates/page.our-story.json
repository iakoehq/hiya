We spent three years curating top pediatricians, nutritionists, scientists, and parents to formulate a super-powered chewable made with 15 essential vitamins and minerals while also including a blend of 12 fruits and veggies. The result is Hiya — a daily children’s vitamin that’s supercharged to help fill in the gaps — and always with zero added sugar and zero gummy junk — so you can be confident your kids are getting the full-body nourishment they need to grow into healthy adults."
