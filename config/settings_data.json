That's why we designed all orders to be easy-to-start, easy-to-cancel as part of our monthly subscription, which includes a free and easy cancellation and ability to control your delivery date. Your first month you receive a 30-day supply of fresh vitamins and a reusable glass bottle meant to be personalized with stickers. Then each month thereafter you receive a recyclable refill pouch to fill up your bottle with fresh vitamins. The monthly experience is based on a pediatrician-recommended delivery schedule and is designed to teach your children healthy habits and care for the environment."

We’ve all seen what happens when our kid’s stomachs are acting up, yet what we don’t see is how much the gut is the control center for little kid’s bodies. Since toddlers are born with a sterile GI system (that unfortunately gets further impacted by processed foods, added sugar, and antibiotics), a good probiotic is now seen as an essential way to support a healthy immune system, yet so many probiotics are dead on arrival."

Hiya is designed for optimal absorption, individually selected for childhood needs, and sent straight to you with an evolving formula so your probiotic actives remain strong and your kids get a variety of benefits."

              "questions": "Why should kids take a separate probiotic rather than include probiotics in a multivitamin?",

Our monthly subscription is easy to start, easy to cancel and includes the ability to control your delivery date. Your first month you receive a 30-day supply of fresh probiotics and a reusable glass bottle meant to be personalized with stickers. Then each month thereafter you receive a recyclable refill pouch to fill up your bottle with fresh probiotics. The monthly experience is based on a pediatrician-recommended delivery schedule and is designed to teach your children healthy habits and care for the environment. If you’ve also ordered our multivitamin, we’ll do our best to coordinate so you get both vitamins and probiotics shipped together."

The result is unfortunately many kids have a difficult time winding down both their body and their mind, which can translate to general unease, restless sleep, and sub-optimal development. While the nutrients we select are not the only way to relax and restore, they can be a key component for all types of kids."

For example, L-theanine is an amino acid known to support calm and relaxation while b6 is a key vitamin known to support brain restoration in kids. As with our other products, as experts learn more about what exactly takes place during relaxation and wind down, our formulations will always take the latest science into account."

Added sugar is especially bad before bed, gummy additives can get stuck in teeth and contribute to cavities at night, and melatonin might not be necessary for the vast majority of kids and may instead contribute to unwanted issues."

While many of these situations were innocuous, about ten percent led to treatment at healthcare facilities. Additionally, many experts are asking increasing questions about melatonin and puberty. Our view is unless melatonin is prescribed by a pediatrician, melatonin among kids should be far less common than it is."
